Inspired by [usesthis.com](https://usesthis.com) I decided to share my current computer setup.

**Hardware**

After much deliberation between the 2018 Dell XPS 13, Huawei Matebook X Pro, Lenovo X1, I decided on a lesser known computer namely the ThinkPenguin y=mx+b or if you want to get technical the Clevo N141WU. Mine is configured with an intel core i7-8550U, with a single stick of DDR4 2400MHz Crucial Ram (with a spare slot), and a Samsung 970 EVO NVMe M.2 SSD.

**Operating System**

I use [Debian] linux, this is the only OS installed on my computer. If something breaks I need to figure out how to fix it or I won't have a computer to use, this an excellent motivator ;)

As a learning exercise I installed only the basics to necessary to boot, then installed and configured each component individually.

**Window Manager**

I use Calm Window Manager, which is the default window manager for OpenBSD. The man page for cwm is well written, I've customized a few things in my .cwmrc file

**Compositor**

I am using compton for transparent colors and fading when opening or closing windows.  This program hasn't been updated in a while but it's working beautifully for now.

**Terminal**

I am using st from suckless.org.  This is included in the Debian stable repo, but to get the most out of it you should compile it yourself from [source](https://st.suckless.org/). The trick I learned here is **apt-get build-dep** *packagename*. A huge time saver when you are trying to find all the miscellaneous libraries necessary to compile said package from source.

**Fonts**

I am using two truetype fonts.

**Font Awesome 4** for displaying icons in the status bar and **mononoki** as my everything else monospaced font

**Wallpaper**

feh with the --bg-fill option.  I get my backgrounds from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com)

**Other Software**

Programs I use daily

- Rofi (Application Launcher)
- xbindkeys (Key Mapping)
- xsecurelock (Screen Lock)
- pass (Password Manager)
- Firefox
- Spotify
- vim

**Status Bar**

[bar by LemonBoy](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) with TTF font support.
[A bash script](https://github.com/manila/bin/blob/master/bar) that pipes information to be displayed, updated every 2 seconds 

**Backing up my scripts and dotfiles**

GNU stow and github

The next time I decide to re-install nix and load my dotfiles, I can simply type: 
```bash
git pull https://manila.github.com/dotfiles ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles && stow .
```
or for my scripts:
```bash
git pull https://manila.github.com/bin ~/bin
```

**My Dotfiles**

You can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/manila/dotfiles) from github
